# Webstatistics project
Hello, this is the project I made for my school graduation project in 2021
The aim of the project was to create a webapp that analyzes access data from visitors of a website (I created a simple one just to work on it and set all the config) and to visually display trends and statistics with graphs/counters etc.
I had absolutely no statistics knowledge when I developed this webapp, so something can be wrong/inexactly :))

Simple website in analysis (try to open different pages to test the application):
http://webstatistics.altervista.org/ELABORATO/root/website/

Statistics dashboard (user/pw:admin):

Enjoy :)
